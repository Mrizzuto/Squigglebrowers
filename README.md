# Squigglebrowers
### Chrome Extension

Hello and Welcome to my Chrome Extension, Squigglebrowser.

Squigglebrowser started as an ambitious project to deliver an irritating user experiance on google chrome and any of 
your favorite sites. Squigglebrowser works by altering the text size of elements on a webpage, just a little. 
I hoped for the subtle effect to be hard to notice, the kind of thing that you see in your periphary and then take 
a second, closer, look at. It turned out to be a bit more complicated. Its appended functionality effects text on a page by fluxuating font size for all elements, it appears sporatic and unwildy, a welcome side effect of having not attempted coding for 2 months. The extension is free to use and it sure is irritating. I can hardly use my computer when im using Squigglebrowers - its aweful. Thanks for downloading squigglebrowers and happy browsing!

Enclosed within this repository you will find:
extension.js        -- the place were all the magic happens and the source of unrelenting trial and error :) .
icon.pgn     	    -- the logo custom made by our delevopers here at Squigglebrowers (its an S (for squiggle)).
jquery-3.2.1.min.js -- actually the place where all the magic happens, jquery is the backbone of this extension
background.js	    -- which adds functionality to the icon.png and allows users to activate the plugin.
manifest.json       -- a description of the extension and the means of communicating with google and chrome.
